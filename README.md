### Invalid options object. Dev Server has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema 

**Solve:** My issue was I was on the 'MARH_S_118' so some internet worked, but this must have blocked whatever npm needs....connecting to the proper wifi (Example: eduroam) fixed it.
